        <h1>INTRO TO EXERCISE</h1>
        <p class="written-by">- Written by Kevin Joshi</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and
            wellness.<br><br>
            It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, preventing aging, developing
            muscles and the cardiovascular system, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improving
            health and also for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in
            groups, socialize, and enhance well-being.<br><br>
            In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise,
            and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.<br>

        <h3>7 Most Effective Exercises</h3>
        <hr>
        <dl>
            <dt>1. Walking</dt>
            <dd>Why it's a winner: You can walk anywhere, anytime. Use a treadmill or hit the streets.<br>
                How to: If you're just starting to walk for fitness, begin with five to 10 minutes at a time. Add a few
                minutes to each walk until you get to at least 30 minutes per walk. Then, quicken your pace or add
                hills. </dd>
            <dt>2. Interval Training</dt>
            <dd>Why it's a winner: Interval training boosts your fitness levels and burns more calories to help you lose
                weight. The basic idea is to vary the intensity within your workout, instead of going at a steady
                pace.<br>
                How to: Whether you walk, run, dance, or do another cardio exercise, push up the pace for a minute or
                two. Then back off for 2 to 4 minutes. How long your interval should last depends on the length of your
                workout and how much recovery time you need. A trainer can fine-tune the pacing. Repeat the intervals
                throughout your workout.</dd>
            <dt>3. Squats</dt>
            <dd>Why it's a winner: Squats work several muscle groups -- your quadriceps ("quads"), hamstrings, and
                gluteals ("glutes") -- at the same time.<br>
                How to: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart and your back straight. Bend your knees and lower your rear
                as if you were sitting down in a chair. Your weight should be evenly distributed on 3 points of your
                feet -- heel, outaside ball, inside ball -- that form a triangle. Your knees won't stay in line with
                your ankles that way, but there will be less strain on other parts of your body. Add dumbbells once you
                can do 12 reps with good form.</dd>
            <dt>4. Lunges</dt>
            <dd>Why it's a winner: Like squats, lunges work all the major muscles of your lower body. They can also
                improve your balance.<br>
                How to: Take a big step forward, keeping your back straight. Bend your front knee to about 90 degrees.
                Keep weight on your back toes and drop the back knee toward the floor. Don't let the back knee touch the
                floor. </dd>
            <dt>5. Push-Ups</dt>
            <dd>Why it's a winner: Push-ups strengthen your chest, shoulders, triceps, and core muscles.<br>
                How to: Facing down, place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Place your toes on the
                floor. If that's too hard, start with your knees on the floor. Your body should make a straight line
                from shoulders to knees or feet. Keep your rear-end muscles and abs engaged. Bend your elbows to lower
                down until you almost touch the floor. Lift back up by pushing through your elbows, Keep your torso in a
                straight line throughout the move.</dd>
            <dt>6. Crunches</dt>
            <dd>Start by lying on your back with your feet flat on the floor and your head resting in the palm of one
                hand and the other hand reaching toward your knees. Press your lower back down. Contract your abdominal
                muscles (abs) and in one smooth move, raise your head, then your neck, shoulders, and upper back off the
                floor. Tuck in your chin slightly. Lower back down and repeat.</dd>
            <dt>7. Bent-Over Row</dt>
            <dd>Why it's a winner: You work all the major muscles of your upper back, as well as your biceps.<br>
                How to: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend your knees, and bend forward at the hips. Engage
                your abs without hunching your back. Hold weights beneath your shoulders, keeping your hands
                shoulder-width apart. Bend your elbows and lift both hands toward the sides of your body. Pause, then
                slowly lower your hands to the starting position. Can perform with a bar or dumbbells.</dd>
